## 📋 Pre-Upload Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub, verify:

- [ ] `output_detection.mp4` exists and plays correctly
- [ ] README.md displays correctly (check video tag)
- [ ] All code files are present
- [ ] `.gitignore` is working (no large files tracked)
- [ ] Requirements.txt is up to date
- [ ] License file is included

## 🚀 Upload to GitHub

### Step 1: Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
git init
```

### Step 2: Add Files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Intelligent Parking Management System

- Vehicle detection using YOLO11
- License plate detection using CV methods
- Real-time video processing
- Professional documentation"
```

### Step 4: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: `parking-management-system-using-CV`
4. Description: "Intelligent Parking Management System using Computer Vision - Vehicle and License Plate Detection"
5. Set to Public (for portfolio)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 5: Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/parking-management-system-using-CV.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📝 After Upload

1. **Verify README**: Check that the video displays correctly
2. **Add Topics**: Add topics like `computer-vision`, `yolo`, `opencv`, `python`, `parking-system`
3. **Add Description**: Update repository description
4. **Pin Repository**: Pin it to your GitHub profile (if desired)

## 🎯 Portfolio Presentation Tips

1. **Highlight in Portfolio**: 
   - Mention it's a 5th-semester Computer Vision project

   - Real-time processing capability
   - Advanced validation to reduce false positives
   - Clean, modular code architecture

3. **Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
   - Deep Learning (YOLO11)
   - Computer Vision (OpenCV)
   - Python Programming
   - Video Processing
   - Software Engineering Best Practices

## 📊 Project Stats (for your portfolio)

- **Technologies**: Python, OpenCV, YOLO11, PyTorch
- **Lines of Code**: ~1000+ (estimated)
- **Modules**: 2 main detection modules
- **Features**: Real-time vehicle & license plate detection
- **Performance**: 30-60 FPS (hardware dependent)
